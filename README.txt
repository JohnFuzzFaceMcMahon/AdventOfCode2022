Once again, I'm going to try and do this in awk. Specifically, I'll be using gawk. If I hit a
wall I will likely switch to Perl or C. UPDATED 2022-12-04: I am now reworking each solution in go. 
I am not using go as my primary language yet.

You can find last years effort at https://github.com/JohnFuzzFaceMcMahon/awkAdventOfCode2021.
I finished 12.5 challenges using awk. Basically I ran into a time crunch, and some of the
problems were beyond the capabilities of an awk interpreter.

After I have solved a problem and a few days (UPDATED 2022-12-06: I'm pretty much pushing them when they
are finished) have gone by I will commit my solution here.

Have fun!
